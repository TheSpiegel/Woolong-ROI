## 🪙 Project Overview 🪙

The primary goal of Woolong ROI is to provide independent sellers with a streamlined interface to calculate Return on Investment (ROI), track net profits after platform fees, and manage the inventory lifecycle.

### The Inspiration
The inspiration for this project comes from my father, an active eBay seller. After observing the complexities he faces with sourcing, listing, and manual fee calculations, I wanted to apply my software engineering skills to create a tool that provides immediate value to his daily workflow.

### The Name
The name **Woolong** is a personal tribute to the currency used in *Cowboy Bebop*, the first anime I ever watched. While the name is a nod to that influence, the application is strictly designed as a professional financial utility.
